# Advent of Code 2025

These are my solutions to [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025), written in [Gleam](https://gleam.run).

I completed [AoC 2022 in Erlang](https://github.com/tylerc/advent-of-code-2022) so I'm interested in
seeing how Gleam compares.

## Running the Code

In compliance with AoC rules, the inputs are not committed to this repo. To run these programs, you must:

1. Create a folder named `inputs`.
2. Populate it with files named like `day01.txt` and `day01.example.txt`.

Each individual day can be run by directly executing the Gleam module named after the given day, like so:

```sh
gleam run -m day01
```

Or all solutions can be run with:

```sh
gleam run
```
